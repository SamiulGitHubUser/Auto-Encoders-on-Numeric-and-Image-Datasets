# Auto-Encoders-on-Numeric-and-Image-Datasets
Efficient data codings to Numeric and Image(MNIST) Datasets.

An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner.
The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, 
by training the network to ignore signal “noise”.
